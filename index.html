  <p class="TBH">Tbh the staten island mall was highkey horrible before they added this really awesome food court with taco bell and dave & busters. Its pretty all right now. Like if I had staten island friends than this would be THE spot. They also used to not have a movie theatre, but then they locked in.    </p>
