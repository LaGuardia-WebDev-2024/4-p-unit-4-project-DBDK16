  <h3 class="Coney">Coney Island Park</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Coney Island amusement park is the staple of brighton beach, which is right next to my neighborhood.
    Friends who visit from far away love to spend time there, especially when it gets dark. I also love to go there with
    my best friend at the beginning of july, when the weather is perfect and the park is not as popular.

  <h2>Orso Coffee</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Orso Coffee is my favorite coffee shop. They make the best Chai and Matcha Lattes.
    I recommend anyone who visits my neighborhood to go get blessed by their amazing handcrafted beverages.

  <h2>Manhattan Beach</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Manhattan beach is the name of my neighborhood, but is also the name of 
    our beach. I love going to the beach all year long, whether I am walking
    my dog or tanning in the sun. Anyone who visits my neighborhood
    usually checks out the beach.
